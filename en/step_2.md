This is a very basic RPG game that only has 2 rooms. Hereâ€™s a map of the game:

Look at the code and find the `rooms` variable. The map is coded as a **dictionary** of rooms:

---
language: python
line_numbers: true
line_number_start: 26
line_highlights: 
---
# A dictionary linking a room to other rooms
rooms = {
    'Hall' : {
        'south' : 'Kitchen'
    },
    'Kitchen' : {
        'north' : 'Hall'
    }
}
--- /code ---

Each room is a dictionary, and rooms are linked together using directions.  


--- task ---

Add a dining room to your map, to the east of the hall. **Don't forget to add a comma to the end of the previous line when you add a new direction.**

    'Kitchen' : {

    },
    'Dining Room' : {
        'west' : 'Hall'
    }
}

Click **Stop**, then click **Run** to try out the game with your new dining room code. 

Type `go east` from the hall to move into to the dining room, and `go west` to move back to the hall.
