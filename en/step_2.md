Here is a basic maze that represents a house with two rooms. The rooms are both empty for now. Hereâ€™s a map of the game:

Look at the code and find the `rooms` variable. The map is coded as a **dictionary** of rooms:

---
language: python
line_numbers: true
line_number_start: 29
line_highlights: 
---
# A dictionary linking a room to other rooms
rooms = {
    'Hall' : {
        'south' : 'Kitchen'
    },
    'Kitchen' : {
        'north' : 'Hall'
    }
}
--- /code ---

Each room is a dictionary, and rooms are linked together using directions.  


--- task ---

Add a Dining Room to your map, to the east of the Hall. **Don't forget to add a comma to the end of the previous line when you add a new direction.**

    'Kitchen' : {

    },
    'Dining Room' : {
        'west' : 'Hall'
    }
}

Click **Stop**, then click **Run** to try out the game with your new Dining Room code. 

Type `go east` from the Hall to move into to the Dining Room, and `go west` to move back to the Hall.
