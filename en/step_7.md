## Challenge: Develop your own game

Use what you’ve learnt to create your own game. Add lots of rooms, monsters to avoid and items to collect. Remember to modify the code so that the player wins when they get to a certain room with some of the objects in their inventory. It may help you to sketch a map before you start coding!

You could even add stairs to your map and have more than one level of rooms, by typing `go up` and `go down`.
