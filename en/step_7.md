## What can you do now?

If you are following the [Python: Module 2](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/pathways/python-module-2) pathway, you can move on to the [Robo trumps](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/robo-trumps) project. In this project, you will create a database of robots and play Robo-Trumps with a friend!

Or, why not try out another [Python](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects?software%5B%5D=python) project?
