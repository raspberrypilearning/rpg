## Adding items to collect

Let’s leave items in the rooms for the player to collect as they move through the maze.

+ Adding an item into a room is easy, you can just add it to a room's dictionary. Let’s put a key in the hall.

    Remember to put a comma after the line above the new item, or your program won’t run!

+ If you run your game after adding the code above, you can now see a key in the hall, and you can even pick it up (by typing `get key`) which adds it to your inventory!
