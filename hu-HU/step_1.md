## Introduction:

In this project, you’ll design and code your own RPG maze game. The aim of the game will be to collect objects and escape from a house, making sure to avoid all the monsters!

## Introduction:

This project teaches game design through the development of an RPG maze game. In this game, the player has to pick up objects within a house and get to a specific room, while avoiding monsters lurking in some of the rooms. This game will be achieved by manipulating dictionaries and lists.

## Online Resources

**This project uses Python 3.** We recommend using [trinket](https://trinket.io/) to write Python online. This project contains the following Trinkets:

+ ['RPG' starting point -- jumpto.cc/rpg-go](http://jumpto.cc/rpg-go)

There is also a trinket containing the finished project:

+ [‘RPG’ Finished -- trinket.io/python/d06adeb527](https://trinket.io/python/d06adeb527)

## Offline Resources

This project can be [completed offline](https://www.codeclubprojects.org/en-GB/resources/python-working-offline/) if preferred. You can access the project resources by clicking the 'Project Materials' link for this project. This link contains a 'Project Resources' section, which includes resources that children will need to complete this project offline. Make sure that each child has access to a copy of these resources. This section includes the following files:

+ rpg/rpg.py

You can also find the completed project project in the 'Volunteer Resources' section, which contains:

+ rpg-finished/rpg.py

(All of the resources above are also downloadable as project and volunteer `.zip` files.)

## Learning Objectives

+ Game design;
+ Editing: 
    + Lists;
    + Dictionaries.
+ Boolean expressions.

This project covers elements from the following strands of the [Raspberry Pi Digital Making Curriculum](http://rpf.io/curriculum):

+ [Combine programming constructs to solve a problem.](https://www.raspberrypi.org/curriculum/programming/builder)

## Challenges

+ Adding new rooms;
+ Adding items to collect;
+ Adding enemies to avoid;
+ Develop your own game.

## Frequently Asked Questions

+ Children may need reminding that elements of a dictionary/list are separated by a comma. For example, when adding a new room to the 'rooms' dictionary, a comma needs to be added between the new room being added and the previous room.
+ When adding a new room, children may forget to add a link to an existing room to the newly created room. This will mean that children can leave a room, but not enter it!
+ The code for checking whether the player has won or lost the game needs to be indented, to ensure that this check is performed upon entering each new room. If the code isn't indented, then it sits outside of the main game loop and is never run.
